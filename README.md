# Enterprise Network - CCNA & CCNP Lab

## Project Overview
This project involves setting up a comprehensive enterprise network lab environment using Cisco devices and protocols. The lab is designed to help learners gain hands-on experience with various networking concepts, including access layer configuration, aggregation layer setup, core layer design, routing protocols, and cloud integration.

## Network Topology

## Project Goals
- To build a scalable and redundant enterprise network.
- To implement various routing protocols (OSPF, BGP).
- To configure high availability features (HSRP, VRRP).
- To integrate on-premises network with Azure cloud services.
- To document the entire configuration process for educational purposes.
- To validate configurations through testing and troubleshooting.
- To prepare for CCNA and CCNP certifications.
- To utilize EVE-NG for network emulation.
- To share knowledge through blog posts and tutorials.
- To enhance practical networking skills.
- To create a resource for networking enthusiasts and professionals.
